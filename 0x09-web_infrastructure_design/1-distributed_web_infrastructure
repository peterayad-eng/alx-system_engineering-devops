## Added Components

1. **Second Server**: Eliminate SPOF, enable horizontal scaling
2. **Load Balancer (HAProxy)**: Distributes incoming requests between multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.
3. **Database Primary-Replica Setup (MySQL)**: Read scalability and data redundancy

## Database Cluster

- **Primary**: Handles all writes
- **Replica**: Read-only copy

## Issues with this infrastructure

1. **SPOF**: The Load Balancer and Primary Database are still single points of failure.
2. **Security**: No firewall or HTTPS leaves it vulnerable to attacks.
3. **Monitoring**: Failures and performance issues may go undetected.
