## Added Components

1. **Firewalls (3 total)**: Protect each major component (Load Balancer, Web Server, Database) from unauthorized access by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic.
2. **SSL Certificate**: Encrypts communication between the clientâ€™s browser and the load balancer, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
3. **Monitoring Clients (3 total)**: Collect metrics, logs, and performance data from each server (Load Balancer, Web Server, Database).

## Issues with this infrastructure

1. **SSL Termination at Load Balancer Level**: If decryption happens only at the load balancer and traffic between the load balancer and internal servers is unencrypted, it exposes internal network traffic to potential interception.

2. **Single Primary Database**: Only one MySQL server can accept writes; if it fails, no write operations can be processed, creating a single point of failure for data writes.

3. **Same Components on All Servers**: If each server has all components (DB, Web, App), it may lead to resource contention and increases the attack surface, compromising one server could compromise the entire stack.
