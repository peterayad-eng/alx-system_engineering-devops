## Added Elements

1. **Additional Server**: Added to increase infrastructure capacity and distribute the load more effectively.

2. **Additional Load Balancer (HAProxy) Configured as a Cluster**: Ensures high availability of the load balancing function itself.

3. **Component Separation (Web Server, Application Server, Database on Separate Servers)**: 

	- Web Server (Nginx): Handles static content, SSL termination, and HTTP requests.

	- Application Server: Processes business logic and runs application code.

	- Database Server (MySQL): Stores and manages persistent data.

## Benefits of This Scale-Up

1. **High Availability**: Eliminating single points of failure in load balancing.
2. **Better Performance**: Each component has its own resources, avoiding bottlenecks.
3. **Scalability**: You can independently add more servers for web, application, or database as traffic grows.
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Failure in one service layer doesnâ€™t stop the others.
